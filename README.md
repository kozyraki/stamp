___Introduction___

The Stanford Transactional Applications for Multi-Processors (STAMP) is a
collection of applications well suited for transactional memory research. For
each application, STAMP includes sequential code, parallel code that uses
coarse-grain transactions, and reference data sets. We provide transactional
code for both HTM and STM systems, and provide an STM system based on TL2 [3]. A
characterization of the applications is given in [1] and [2].

We are currently working on additional STAMP applications and welcome your
feedback, corrections, and suggestions. If you make some improvements to STAMP,
we would appreciate receiving a copy that we can include in the next release.

If you use STAMP in your work, please cite [1]. Thanks for using STAMP!


___Distribution Contents___

This directory contains the following items:

    AUTHORS ----- A list of people who have contributed to STAMP
    LICENSE ----- BSD-style license; if you use STAMP, please let us know
    README.md ------ This file
    VERSIONS ---- Revision history
    bayes/ ------ Bayesian network structure learning benchmark  
    common/ ----- Common Makefile variables and rules
    labyrinth/ -- Maze routing benchmark
    lib/ -------- Common libraries (data structures, etc.)
    genome/ ----- Gene sequencing benchmark
    intruder/ --- Network intrusion detectino benchmark
    kmeans/ ----- K-means clustering benchmark
    ssca2/ ------ Graph kernel benchmark
    vacation/ --- Travel reservation system benchmark
    yada/ ------- Delaunay mesh refinement benchmark

Each of the benchmarks contains a README file that has a description of the
program and inputs and instructions for compilation and running. There are
different Makefiles to build different flavors (e.g., sequential, stm, etc.).

To adapt the benchmarks for a particular TM system, change lib/tm*. These files
contain documentation on the purpose and usage of each of the macros.

For general compilation changes (e.g., choice of compiler), edit common/*.


___Platforms___

STAMP has been tested on Ubuntu 6, Ubuntu 7, Fedora Core 5, Fedora Core 6,
CentOS 4, and CentOS 5, on both 32-bit i386 and 64-bit x86_64 architectures.
