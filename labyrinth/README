Introduction
------------

Given a maze, this benchmark finds the shortest-distance paths between pairs of
starting and ending points. The routing algorithm used is Lee's algorithm [2].

In this algorithm, the maze is represented as a grid, where each grid point can
contain connections to adjacent, non-diagonal grid points. The algorithm
searches for a shortest path between the start and end points of a connection by
performing a breadth-first search and labeling each grid point with its distance
from the start. This expansion phase will eventually  reach the end point if a
connection is possible. A second traceback phase then forms the connection by
following any path with a decreasing distance. This algorithm is guaranteed to
find the shortest path  between a start and end point; however, when multiple
paths are made, one path may block another.

When creating the transactional version of this program, the techniques
described in [3] were used. When using this benchmark, please cite [1].


Compiling and Running
---------------------

To build the application, simply run:

    make -f <makefile>

in the source directory. For example, for the sequential flavor, run:

    make -f Makefile.seq

By default, this produces an executable named "labyrinth", which can then be
run in the following manner:

    ./labyrinth -i <input_file>

The following input file is recommended for simulated runs:

    ./labyrinth -i inputs/random-x32-y32-z3-n96.txt

For non-simulator runs, a larger input can be used:

    ./labyrinth -i inputs/random-x512-y512-z7-n512.txt


Input Files
-----------

More input sets can be generated by using "inputs/generate.py". For example,

    inputs/generate.py 128 128 3 64

Will create a 128x128x3 maze grid and select 64 uniformly random start/end
point pairs.
